Digital logic

software-OS
some hardware-surface lecel

interacts with CPU

Dgital logic is bottom level-gates above capacitors
gates at least 1 input and 1 output
logic operators
truth tables

or gate -curved
and gate -squared

PNP and NPN transistors

pic in comp sci
PNP on when signal high
NPN on when signal low

gates are abstractions of circuits

Combinational: only based on inputs
Sequential: state of previous plus inputs

pins leaves chips
