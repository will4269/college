Digital Computers: Bits and binary
Analog Computers: Tapes, and mechanical calculators
Quantum Computers: really weird
human computer: old school

digitals are easy to build and fast, but inaccurate and hard to program

* Why binary
Simple two State
low and hi
work on voltage levels

Hardware, software, and software 

Communication lines buses

CPU
-control unit
-registers
-Arithmetic control unit (ALU)
-Buses
-*added GPU
-*Networking
-*Cache

Primary memory -Random Access Memory
fundemental unit 8-bits BYTE

2^10 1024=1kibibyte KiB ,2^20 ~1million bytes MiB, 2^30 gibibyte,

Cumbersome to control all aspects of computer
Also, use CPU to full potential

OS
program that controlls all
runs programs as processes
pseudoparallelism (multiprogramming, multiprocessing)

CPU only understands voltage patterns
Computers are Von neuman machines or stored-program and read and run it

So, we made languages like assembly

thne FORTRAN, COBOL, LISP, ALGOL -1950
today C,C++,C#, Java, Python, Rust, Go

Mainframe-high speed old boys "Big Irons"
Workstations-"minicomputer"
Mainframes today are servers with virtual machines.
