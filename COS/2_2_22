An Object is something we defined instatiation

class is definition

ABSTRACTION-IGNORE and hide what isnt needed or uneccessary

Encapsulation- the ability to limit a class as opposed to inflate the above

Inheritance- something is something else, playdoh is orange playdoh. Extends a class with more specific behavior. 

Polymorphism- many classes involved in one object.
