A class should, be defined abstractly, clear role (1 job), clear operations, relate in some way.

critical componets of a class
-Declaration
  same name of class to file.java
  capital of first letter
  must use curly bracket
  one class per file
  
  
 -Instance variables
   scope-spatial representation of variable
  lifetime- time representation of variable
  global, local, class level variables
  local lifetime, duration of function
  class lifetime, duration of the objcet
  global lifetime, program execution
  
  instance variable (car)
    -fuel level
    -tire pressure
    -tire rotation
    relevant to one instance of car
 
-function overloading
    
 every object must have one or more constructor methods.
 is called automatically via new.
 may have multiple constructors via function overloading
 public Car() //default
 public Car(String make) //parameterized for string
 public Car(String make, String model) // takes two strings
 return type is the type of the function.
 
 default is a parameterized constructor with no inputs.
 parameterized -specific, default vague
 
 accessors and mutators, effect private data.
 
 accessors sole purpose to return private data member
 -getMake()
 -getModel()
 not void
 
 mutator sole purpose to take and set a private data member
 
 
 why bother with getters and setters
 
 sanitization inputs
 
 if correct assign it
 else we can do some errors
 include getters and setters
 
 car must have method for refueling
 has safe guards about overfilling
 
 function works with or on the class, than any function is a good method.
