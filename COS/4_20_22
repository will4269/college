hash tables

int hash(int key){
  return key/10000
  }
  
  fails on clashing numbers 513-0000 and 513-0001
  
  hashing hopes for nice cases
  
  Open addressing technique \
  
  if something here look next
  
  to search for a thing in for a next empty slot is linear
  
  a collison requires sequential traversal of linkend list
  
  However with an efficent hash function, these lists should be short
  
 hash depends on
 quality of function
 collision resolution technique
 capacity of hash
