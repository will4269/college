what is an object

name

Array stack
push pop peek
LIFO

array vs linked list

linked list non-contiguous

tail and other variables in linked list

cannot assume they exist

pre-post order

height variance of 1 to be balanced

emppty tree -1

leaf is zero 

1 + maximum of their descendants = height

heap value of descendants are larger than root for root early or vice versa

nlog(n) for heap

bigO

O(1) 1.
O(n) 3.
O(n^2) 4.
O(log(n)) 2.

1. is best

O(nlog(n))
O(2^n)nested loops
O(n!)

Exception
try{}
catch{}
handeled vs unhandeled

collections

collection->list->arraylist/linkedlist
abstract abstract class concrete class.
