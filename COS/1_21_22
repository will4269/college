JAVA
-type casting to determine what something is
"  " -letters
""  "" -string
**Unable to infer types in python**, we need to say: x is an integer and =5

definition, declaration, and initialization are seperate 

-declaration
  Provide the type of a data member
  
-initialization
  Assign a value to a data member
  
  int x=5: #java
  x=5 #python
  x=5.5 #python, probably a float
  double x=5.5 #java, we use doubles in class
  
  float vs double : 4bytes vs 8bytes
  
JAVA and C use static typed primitives
  -permanent assignments
  PRO
  -memory usage
  -best performance
  CON
  -not flexible
  
types
(primitives)
-int {}
-float
-double {}
-long 8 digits (long long 8 digits, sometimes 16 inother studios)
-short (2 bytes)
-byte
#numbers

-char
#single symbol
-boolean
(non-primitives)
-list
-Array
-String
-Files
-any other object

Semicolon ; to seperate lines 

public int Helloworld(){
  System.out.println("Hello World");
  return 5;
}


Public vs Private : who can provide it
type for function means a blank will send something out of it or a void function

built in print system.out.println(""); or system.out.print("");
