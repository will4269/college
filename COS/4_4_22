Traversals

O(Log(n))

A can have at most 2 descendants (our choice)

A child is either a left or righ child

One descendant is sub optimal, gaps in trees are bad to

a traversal is a specific pattern of access across a tree

could be 

in,pre, post order

left,mid,right inorder
mid,left,right pre
left,right,mid post

use recursion till a case such as left and right are null.

inorder is a weird one, not respected beyond binary tree. 
sorting not searching.

the inorder of a binary search tree is always in sorted order

self balancing even on both sides.

wrapper around the tree

linkedQueue was a wrapper for linear node

used linearnode to perform Queues function and protext linearnode

Tree node has root like Queue head.

Insert to tree
Remove to tree

exception handling is majorly important.
