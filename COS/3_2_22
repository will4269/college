ArrayStack

Array-Contiguous,Statically,One fixed size (usually)

ArrayList-removes limits of size but generates errors in random placement and more memory usage

ArrayStack-(Stack is the keyword)

Stack-a linear collection in hwhich all insertions (pushes) and removals (pop) occur at one end called the top

Stack is LIFO (Last in First Out) data storage, test Ques

The top is public, rest is private/ represents black box

push-add an item to stack
pop-remove item from top of stack
peek-return value at top
empty-determine if stack is empty
size-number of items in stack

POP-raise a collection-based exception
needs error checker
handeld exception

T, is the type passed into generic
public interface Stack<T>{
public void push (T element);
public T pop();
public T peek();
}

Concerend with perfomance of the most common algorithim the most

POP-always removes top item, but other things can be changed

Stack must be private, only the 5 methods

public class ArrayStack<T> implements Stack<T> {
private int capacity; // initial capacity private int top; // top represents number of elements
private T[ ] stack; // generic array reference

stack = new T [capacity];
