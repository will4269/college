Exam next time, 

what if something keeps equalaling null.

update LinkedStack to LinkedStack2

to get rig of null testing

IE, head==null

null.reference.exception
exception, 
an attempt to reach null memory address, 

referencing zero leads to a segmentation fault. SO DONT GET NULL

Exception handling

exceptions-logical error raised by our program

exceptions don't result in crashes

You can't see a crash

Unhandled exception, no exceotion handling

Try-Catch blocks

Defensive Coding

Dequeue,peak

if(head==null){
}

for here it should return null, if head has null. becuase head was null.

try{
  LinearNode<T> temp = head;
  head= head.getNext();
  size--;
  return temp.getElement;
}
catch(Exception e){//catch all term e
}
or better yet
catch(NullPointerException e){
  Sys.out.println(e.getMessage());//not necessary
  return null;
}

helps with debugging, e carries all debugger info

avoids the if statement, is avoided and only deals with error case.

catch only do one neccesary and no more.
