stepper motor
ch16

magnetic field to rotate connector, AC\DC

Exact motor movemet
-stepper motor, move in tiny steps due to many magnets
-servo motors, feedback can be just normal motor

Bi polar motors, transmorfer with AC current to flip poles
H-bridge typically used

or Uni-polar

Stepper motor,
two rings south and north, offset so rotator always moves

stepper resistance 50ohm
need 5v
need 100mA

board only has 10mA
use Darlington Transistor pair

two transstors hooked about to each other that mplify current, with diodes

Kickback current, is prevented by diodes, kickback is casued by induced current from stepper motors
Stepper motor, can be used to stop by using power to keep magnet on

pairs of magnets that will turn on out of phase of the other to move the rotor, wave stepping
